# Genetic Algorithm
___

The main parts of this repository is in folder GeneticAlgorithm. SteadyStateGeneticAlgorithm.R and steady_state_genetic_algorithm.py are the main source code. **Real-Parameter Optimazation Problem** are supposed to be solved in this repository, at least for now.

For file SteadyStateGeneticAlgorithm.R, there are 2 library must be installed first, **ggplot2 and dplyr**. These library can be installed via RStudio or execution following code in your R's terminal.
```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```
Following image is objective function (a.k.a. fitness function) and  steady-state Genetic-Algorithm (steady-state GA) return {(x, y) | x,y ~ max[f(x,y)]}
